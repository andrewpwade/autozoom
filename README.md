## 🎉 What is Auto Text Zoom?

Ever visited a website and found yourself leaning closer to the screen, squinting at impossibly small text? 😤 We've all been there!

**Auto Text Zoom** is your vision's best friend 👀✨ - it automatically detects when text is too small and smoothly zooms the page to make everything perfectly readable. No more manual zooming, no more eye strain!

This is better than the existing browser feature "Minimum font level" because it zooms the entire page which reduces the chance of messing up the UI!

It's better than the "Default zoom level" feature because the extension won't zoom sites that don't need zooming!

## ✨ Features

🔍 **Smart Detection** - Automatically spots tiny text before you do  
⚡ **Instant Action** - Smooth zoom transitions that feel natural  
🎚️ **Your Rules** - Set your perfect font size threshold (2-24px)  
📏 **Custom Zoom** - Choose your ideal zoom level (100-200%)  
💾 **Memory Magic** - Remembers your preferences across all devices  
🎯 **Respectful** - Never overrides your existing zoom settings  
🔄 **Easy Reset** - One-click return to original size  
🧠 **Content Smart** - Focuses on actual content, ignores decorative text
